# Video Performance Optimization

## Overview
This implementation optimizes video performance by using viewport-aware loading/unloading to reduce CPU usage and memory consumption.

## Key Features

### 1. Viewport-Aware Video Loading
- Videos only load when they enter the viewport (with 100px buffer)
- Videos unload when they leave the viewport to free up resources
- Uses Intersection Observer API for efficient viewport detection

### 2. Smart Resource Management
- Automatic video source management (load/unload)
- Proper cleanup of video elements and event listeners
- Prevents memory leaks and reduces CPU usage

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- Real-time tracking of video loading states
- Development-mode debugger showing performance metrics
- Memory usage calculations and optimization insights

## Implementation Details

### Core Hook: `useVideoOptimization`
```javascript
const { isInViewport, isLoaded } = useVideoOptimization(videoRef, src, {
  rootMargin: '100px',    // Load videos 100px before they enter viewport
  threshold: 0.1,         // Trigger when 10% of video is visible
  autoPlay: true,         // Auto-play when loaded and in viewport
  // ... other options
});
```

### Video Component Changes
- Uses `useVideoOptimization` instead of basic `useVideoCleanup`
- Conditionally renders video source based on load state
- Properly handles autoplay when videos enter viewport

### Context Enhancements
- Tracks total, visible, and loaded video counts
- Provides performance metrics for monitoring
- Enables debugging capabilities in development mode

## Performance Benefits

- **Reduced CPU Usage**: Only videos in viewport are actively loaded
- **Memory Optimization**: Unloaded videos free up memory resources
- **Better User Experience**: Faster page loading and smoother scrolling
- **Bandwidth Savings**: Videos only load when needed

## Development Monitoring

In development mode, a performance monitor appears in the top-right corner showing:
- Total number of videos
- Currently visible videos
- Currently loaded videos
- Memory saved percentage

## Configuration Options

The optimization can be fine-tuned with these parameters:
- `rootMargin`: Distance from viewport edge to trigger loading
- `threshold`: Percentage of video visibility required to trigger
- `autoPlay`: Whether to auto-play videos when they load
- Load/unload delay timers to prevent flickering

## Browser Support

- Uses Intersection Observer API (modern browser support)
- Fallback behavior for unsupported browsers
- Tested across Chrome, Safari, and Firefox

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add priority loading for above-the-fold videos
- [ ] Implement progressive loading for large video files
- [ ] Add bandwidth-aware loading strategies
- [ ] Consider WebP video format support
